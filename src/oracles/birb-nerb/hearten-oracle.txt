"This oracle can be consulted when looking for inspiration for the Hearten move. When using such a prompt to flesh out your personal background information, current feelings and other interpersonal stories, you can decide to do a regular Hearten move or let everyone involved take +1 spirit. When using an oracle prompt that establishes a truth about another PC, make sure they are okay with it. Try to use the prompts in a way that everyone involved can grow, especially for the ones with a negative touch to it. There should be no hard feelings afterwards.

You may choose a prompt fitting the current situation or let the dice decide.

If possible and fitting, try to connect the prompts to your current situation to make them more meaningful."
