MOON GENERATION:
The type of the world determines how many moons it may (or may not) have. Roll the
following to determine the number of moons:

Desert World: 1d6 -1
Ice World: 1d6
Ocean World: 1d6 -2
Tainted World: 1d6 -2
Furnace World: 1d6 -2
Jovian World: 3d6 -5
Rocky World: 1d6 -2
Vital World: 1d6 -3
Grave World: 1d6 - 2
Jungle World: 1d6 -2
Shattered World: 1d6 -3
Custom World:* 1d6 -2

* Custom worlds being worlds added by other mods or homebrew material.
Note: if, during world generation, the tables state that a world has certain types of
moons, add those moons to these totals. You can detail any additional moons using the
tables below.

MOON TYPES:
For each moon that a planet has, roll on the table below to determine what kind of moons
these are.

d100 Moon Types
01-05 Rocky Moon: Treat as a tiny Rocky World.
06-10 Desert Moon: Treat as a tiny Desert World.
11-15 Ice Moon: Treat as a tiny Ice World.
16-20 Furnace Moon: Treat as a tiny Furnace World.
21-25 Grave Moon: Treat as a tiny Grave World
26-30 Vital Moon: Treat as a tiny Vital World
31-35 Jungle Moon: Treat as a tiny Jungle World
36-40 Shattered Moon: Treat as a tiny Shattered World.
41-45 Ocean Moon: Treat as a tiny Ocean World.
46-50 Tainted Moon: Treat as a tiny Tainted World
51-55 Jovian Moon: Treat as a tiny Jovian World.
56-60 Artificial Moon: See tables
61-65 Dust Ring: See tables
66-70 Crystalline: See tables
71-95 Exotic Moon: Roll on the Exotic Moons table.
96-00 Sister Moons: Add a moon to your total and roll again on this table.

* When you survey a moon, roll it up using the tables associated with its type. Use tables from the
core rulebook that match those types, but use the tables below for all other types. If you roll a type
and then roll that it has moons, automatically treat those as tiny satellites that are basically just
captured asteroids.
Smaller, More Realistic Moons (Optional): When rolling on Atmosphere, Settlements and Life
tables associated with a world type to determine these aspects for a given moon (like an Ice Moon
or a Jungle Moon,) you may subtract 20 from each score. This can reflect the difficulty that smaller
planetary bodies have of retaining atmosphere (and therefore, also affecting their ability to support
life.) Of course, you can also have very viable, terraformed moons with advanced Precursor
technology making them amazing, so ultimately it's up to you.


These satellites are huge, moon-sized space stations. Who built this moon and why? How
old is it?

EXOTIC PLANETS:
So, full disclosure, I copied the entries for the Exotic Moons table from an RPG I made a
while ago called Highest Skies (now on Itch!). The original tables are part of a solar system
generator in the core rulebook and are used for generating exotic planets. As such, if you
want to roll on these tables to generate your own exotic planets for Starforged, they could
be used to provide interesting prompts for you to build strange new worlds off of.
You can also use the tables for Artificial Moons, Crystalline Moons and Dust Rings to
generate similar planets, like artificial planets, crystalline planets and planets that have
been reduced to dust. If you do, you can totally use the table below when generating new
planets.
Another great resource for ideas is www.highestskies.com which has over 70 planets on it
for you to explore in the game of your choice for free.
