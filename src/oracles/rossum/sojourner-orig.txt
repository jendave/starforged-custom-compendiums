The Starforged Sojourner
Starforged oracles by Mischa D. Krilov
When you are seeking in a community...
This is a series of oracles for use with Ironsworn: Starforged, by Shawn Tomkin. Depending on
the recovery move you are making (NB: this version currently only has Hearten and Heal), the below
tables may be used to enhance your game.
As a general rule, if a roll doesn't seem to fit your fiction, first try flipping the digits- read the
ones as tens and the tens as ones. (e.g. a roll of 41 becomes 14)
Companions (Hearten)
When you have found companionship, roll twice. The first result is part of your initial attraction. The
second result will be revealed very soon into the conversation. Feel free to use the Character oracles on
page 330 as needed. The heart wants what the heart wants.
01-05  Smoky, arresting eyes          51-55                Lithe like a dancer
06-10  Well-connected, idealistic     56-60                Unbalanced and compatible
11-15  Sullen and magnetic            61-65                Charmingly loud, friendly
16-20  Generous with spending         66-70                Stronger than average
21-25  Under the influence            71-75                Clever, witty, silver-tongued
26-30  Dangerous and charismatic      76-80                Fashionable, pursued by others
31-35  Earthy, sultry, willing        81-85                Well-fed, comfortable

Food - Spice level (Hearten)
When you taste new food, you may roll +heart or roll +iron to see if you can handle the spice level in this
community. On a strong hit, it's perfectly seasoned and others notice your good taste. On a weak hit, you
must add some kind of seasoning or need the dish to be remade, which causes a few raised eyebrows,
teasing, or minor social discomfort. On a miss, you can't handle the flavors and embarrass yourself; lose
1 momentum or 1 spirit.
Alternatively, you may roll to determine the standard spice level for this community.
01-10  Not spicy                      61-80                Extremely spicy, very good
11-30  Subtly spicy, enhances flavor  81-90                Help me, too spicy
31-60  A good kick, satisfying        91-100               Overwhelmingly spicy: Lose     1
                                                           momentum or 1 spirit
Food - Mains (Hearten)
What are we eating? Feel free to use the creature oracles  on page 336 to develop as   needed.
01-10   No/minimal protein                        51-60    Imported meat/protein

41-50   Familiar meat/protein                     91-100   Synthetic meat/protein
Music (Hearten)
When you encounter music, roll once on column A and once on column B. Use the Core Oracles to
determine the song's meaning, intent, or subtext. Notably, the unusual combination of Descriptor (p298)
+ Theme (p297) will generate good song material.

sorrow.

Roommates (Heal)
You're not the only one in need of medical attention. Who are you sharing the room with, or who      else  is
in line for the medico? Evens, they are on their way in. Odds, they are on the mend.
