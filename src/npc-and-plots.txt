The first set of Oracles are for generating an (enhanced) set of NPCs in your game. As always, I
can't resist adding instant "color". The way the Oracles are intended is that you can use them to
generate antagonists or protagonists, as you need, without making any distinction about "good"
and "bad". If I meet a "bitter arms trader" who wants my help, I can make a potential moral decision
about whether or not I'm going to take that NPC up on the offer.
As for plot generators - I can never resist such things!

The concept is simple - roll on NPC Descriptor and NPC Noun Oracles and combine!

earlier tables.
